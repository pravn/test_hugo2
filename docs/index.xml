      <description>We take a look at the Poisson distribution in this post. Continuing on similar lines as in the previous post, we derive the MGF of this distribution. Then we make the connection between the Poisson and the Binomial. This is a cute derivation from Casella and Berger.&#xA;The Poisson distribution takes on the following form:&#xA;$$ \begin{aligned} p(x;\lambda) = \frac {e^{-\lambda} \lambda^x}{x!} \end{aligned} $$ We can see that it is a product of a polynomial and exponential decay term, which are sort of competing influences.</description>

      <description>This is a post to test out my new setup with hugo. I was not very happy with my setup in wordpress owing to lack of flexibility in writing equations. And when it wanted me to pay for it, I sort of gave up on the platform. Suffice it to say that that is the reason for the considerable delay in posting.&#xA;A fair bit has changed since I had last posted.</description>
